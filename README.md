**Architecture**

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).** <br/><br/>
 I used a combination of express and angular for the frontend of the project. The user website uses express and the Admin page uses Angular. The pages were designed using a comibnation of HTML and JavaScript. The admin page is a single-page application, this means that all the page loading is done when the page is accessed. All further updates are done on the client side.

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**<br/><br/>
A MongoDB database can scale much better than a SQL database. I expect that as this website grows it will continue to need to store more trip information for their customers. Something that can be scaled easier is a must here.

Functionality

    How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
    Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

Testing

    Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
