**Architecture**
___

**Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).** <br/><br/>
 I used a combination of express and angular for the frontend of the project. The user website uses express and the Admin page uses Angular. The pages were designed using a comibnation of HTML and JavaScript. The admin page is a single-page application, this means that all the page loading is done when the page is accessed. All further updates are done on the client side.

**Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?**<br/><br/>
A MongoDB database can scale much better than a SQL database. I expect that as this website grows it will continue to need to store more trip information for their customers. Something that can be scaled easier is a must here.

**Functionality**
___

**How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?**<br/><br/>
JSON was orignially derived from Javascript but most programming languages can parse JSON data. JSON is used to store and retrieve data objects. Javascript can be used for this aswell but you wouldn't be able to use a Javascript object with another programming language like you can with JSON. The front and backend are tied together by using JSON.

**Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.**<br/><br/>
In many of the HTML files I implemented templates with handlebars. This allowed me to reuse the specific structure of the page easily. There are many benefits that come from reusable user interface components. The first thing that comes to mind is that is simplifies the design process and development. 

**Testing**
___

**Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.**<br/><br/>
I used common HTTP methods in my application. This included GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. These methods are just actions that users can take when interacting with the endpoints. The method interacts with the server to get the appropriate reaction. The security in this application is used to authenticate users so they can use execute these methods.

Reflection
___

**How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?**<br/><br/>
This course has given me a better understanding of the Full-Stack process. I have gained a better understanding of JSON and Javascript and how they can interact to make a functioning website. While web development is not something I want to do, I definitely think that being more well-rounded can make me a more verstaile employee to hire. I don't see this field of study going anywhere so it is important to learn it if you can.
